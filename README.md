Simulation studies used to test cognitive diagnostic model performance in succesfully predicting students' skills based on their exam results. DINA (Deterministic-Input, Noisy-And-Gate) model was tested in various conditions - different lengths and difficulties of exams, numbers of attributes and Q matrix forms were analysed. Part of my engineering thesis - "Mathematical Models of Diagnostics Assessments in Education".
